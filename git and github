repository = folder where changes are saved.
why are we using?
mainting history of project
which person, what changes are done.
3.) downloading git
run git in cmd and check if it is installed or not
4.) basic kinux commands:
ls
mkdir filename
5.)Intializing git repository
git init - for creating a folder where git stores all the history
ls -a //shows all hidden files, giles with . are hidden files//
6.)Making the first changes
touch filename
git status // to know the changes made//
untracked files - those history is not saved in project(all red files)
git add . or git add nameofthefile
git commit -m "message you wanted to add" // m for message
7.)Adding data to file:
vi filename
:wq to exit
cat filename // to display the contents of the file//
8.)Removing changes from stage
git restore --staged filenames.txt
9.)Viewing all the history of project
git log
10.)Making few more commits
rm -rf filename.txt
git add .
git commit -m "message"
git log
11)Removing a commit from the history of project
whatever the commit hashid we copy, all the above commits above it will be removed
git log
git reset hashid
git log
the commits that are removed will be unstaged area
git status
12)Stashing changes
git add .
git status
touch surnames.txt
git add .
git status
vi surnames.txt
git add .
git status
git stash //don't want to commit changes and don't want to loose it
git log
13)popping stash
git stash pop
14)clearing stash
git add .
git stash
git stash clear
15) starting github and creating a new repository
click on new repository
give a name for repository
you can choose public or private
and click on create repostiory
16) connecitng remote repository to local repository
git remote add origin urloftherepository
remote - means we are working with urls
add - means adding a new url
origin - what is the name of the url that you are going to add
// all the repostiory that are in your personal account will have origin as name
git remote -v //shows all urls attached to this folder
17) Pushing changes to local repository
git push origin branch // git push origin master
push - push the changes
origin - url
branch -which branch you have to push
18) what are branches
touch hotel.txt
git add .
git commit -m "hotel.txt is added"
touch rollno.txt
git add .
git commit -m "rollno.txt is added"
directed acyclic graph
  by default the branch is called master or main
19)Use of branches
you should never commit on main branch
our code which is not finalized yet may contain errors, that's why you never commit changes directly to main branch
20) Learn git branching ( making a new branch and switching to it)
git branch branchname // git branch feature
git checkout branchname
git commit
git checkout main
git commit
